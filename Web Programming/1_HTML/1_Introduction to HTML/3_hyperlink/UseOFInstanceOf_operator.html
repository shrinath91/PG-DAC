    <h1>Use of instanceOf operator</h1>
    <p>The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).</p>

    <p>The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. 
        If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.</p>
