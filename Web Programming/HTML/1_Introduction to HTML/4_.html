    <h1  style="color:rgb(62, 163, 107);"> OOP Concept</h1>
    <p>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.

        Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.<br/> The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
        
        Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
        
        The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.</p>

       1. Object<br/>
       2. Class<br/>
       3. Inheritance<br/>
       4. Polymorphism<br/>
       5. Abstraction<br/>
       6. Encapsulation<br/>

       <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:<br/>
        1. Type Theory in OOP:<br/><br/>
        In OOP, type theory revolves around the idea of defining and manipulating types of objects.
        Classes and Objects: Classes act as blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
        Inheritance: Types are related through inheritance, allowing a subclass to inherit properties and behaviors from a superclass.
        Polymorphism: Types can exhibit multiple forms through polymorphism, enabling objects of different types to be treated uniformly.
        2. Abstraction:<br/><br/>
        Abstraction allows the representation of essential features while hiding unnecessary details.
        Abstract classes and interfaces facilitate the creation of abstract types, providing a foundation for concrete implementations.
        3. Encapsulation:<br/><br/>
        Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.
        Access modifiers control the visibility of members, enforcing encapsulation and data hiding.
        4. Polymorphism:<br/><br/>
        Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.
        Method overriding enables dynamic dispatch, where the appropriate method is invoked at runtime based on the actual object type.</p>

       <h1 style="color: rgb(62, 163, 107);">Interfaces</h1>
       <p>An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a 
           blueprint of a behavior. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.</p>
   
       <h2>What are Interfaces in Java?</h2>
       <p>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. 
           It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java using Interface. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have 
           abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgb(62, 163, 107);">Exception Handling</h1>
        <p>The <b>Exception Handling in Java </b> is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can 
            be maintained.</p>
    
        <p>In this tutorial, we will learn about Java exceptions, it's types, and the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.</p>
        1. Defining Contracts:<br/>
        Interfaces declare a set of methods that implementing classes must define, establishing a contract.
        Classes implementing an interface adhere to the specified structure, promoting consistency.<br/><br/>
        2. Multiple Inheritance:<br/>
        Interfaces enable a form of multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
        This promotes flexibility and code reuse without the issues associated with multiple inheritance in class-based languages.<br/><br/>
        3. Polymorphism and Abstraction:<br/>
        Interfaces support polymorphism by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the interface.
        They provide a level of abstraction, allowing code to interact with objects based on their common interface.
        In summary, the type theory in OOP, exception handling, the instanceof operator, and the use of interfaces collectively contribute to creating robust, modular, and flexible software systems. They provide a foundation for code organization, error handling, type checking, and the implementation of design principles like encapsulation and polymorphism.







        <p><h2>What is Exception in Java?</h2> <br/>
        Dictionary Meaning: Exception is an abnormal condition.</p>
        <p><b>What is Exception Handling?</b> <br/>
            Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.</p>

        <p>Advantage of Exception Handling<br/>
            The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions. Let's consider a scenario:</p>

        <p>Suppose there are 10 statements in a Java program and an exception occurs at statement 5; the rest of the code will not be executed, i.e., statements 6 to 10 will not be executed. However, when we perform exception handling, the rest of the statements will be executed. That is why we use exception handling in Java.</p>
        <p>1. Type Theory in Exception Handling:<br/><br/>
            Exceptions are types that represent exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution.
            The try-catch construct allows for the handling of different types of exceptions.
            2. Checked and Unchecked Exceptions:<br/><br/>
            Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared in the method signature.
            Unchecked exceptions (RuntimeExceptions) need not be explicitly caught or declared.
            3. Throwing and Catching:<br/><br/>
            The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.
            The catch block is responsible for handling the exception, either by recovering from it or rethrowing it.</p>

        <h1 style="color: rgb(62, 163, 107);;">Use of instanceOf operator</h1>
        <p>The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).</p>
    
        <p>The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. 
            If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.</p>

        <p>1. Type Testing:<br/><br/>
            The instanceof operator checks if an object is an instance of a particular class or implements a specific interface.
            It returns a boolean value, indicating whether the object is of the specified type.
            2. Use Cases:<br/><br/>
            Commonly used in conditional statements to determine the type of an object before performing type-specific operations.
            Enhances code safety by avoiding inappropriate type casting.</p>
